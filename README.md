# RecipeCollection-Application

Recipe Collection Application is a simple application that can be operated on both Windows and Mac OS, allowing users to manage their recipes with its clean, simple and user-friendly interface. 

This recipe collection application is my first personal programming project that was completed on my own. 
Since I am quite into cooking and healthy eating, I have a lot of recipes that are either created by myself or learned online, and I like to make meal plans at the beginning of the week and then go grocery shopping accoringly. That's my initiative to create such an application to help me organize my recipes and keep track of them. 

KEY FEATURES:
- Allows users to add, remove, and see the recipes in a quick and easy way

- Provides users with new recipe ideas by searching on a recipe website when user types in the name of an ingredient 

- Includes a "Fridge" function that allows users to add/remove food items to/from the "fridge". When the user clicks on each food item, a list of recipes in the recipe collection that uses this food item will be shown.

- Enables users to save and load user data from existed files
